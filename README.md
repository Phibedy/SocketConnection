# SocketConnection

Basic socket-wrapper for [LMS](https://github.com/Phibedy/LMS)

###Overview
 * It's an easy to use socket-wrapper. It contains a server and a client. <br>
 * By default you will only notified if a complete message has been received (you can disable it behavoir).
   * Four bytes are used to send the size (setting bytesForSize to 0 will disable it)
 * Code + comments should be self-explaining, if you still need help just write an issue and some example will be attached :)

###TODO
 * Doesn't work on windows yet!
